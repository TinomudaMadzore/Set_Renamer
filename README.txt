I built a browser-based file renaming tool using a lightweight Flask backend and a JavaScript frontend, with significant assistance from AI tools during development. The goal was to quickly automate a repetitive file-organisation workflow without building a large application from scratch. While this was not built using a pure no-code platform, the development approach mirrors low-code principles: rapid iteration, AI-assisted generation, and focusing on configuration and workflow rather than heavy boilerplate.
